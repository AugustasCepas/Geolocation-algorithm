# Geolocation task
 
# Admin

## To install & run:
``` 
1) cd geolocation_task/src
2) go run main.go
```

## Things to mention:
```
1) Before launching, database.csv file must be placed to the /src folder

2) Currently, there must be space after the input, for example "LOAD ", "LOOKUP 1.0.0.0 ".

3) Creating an executable and running it with python script, might now work atm.
